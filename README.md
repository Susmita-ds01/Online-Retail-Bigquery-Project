## 🚀 Problems Solved

### 🔹 Problem 1: Best-Selling Products
**Query:** Top 10 products by total revenue.  

SELECT 
  Description AS product,
  ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.Online_Retail`
WHERE Quantity > 0 -- remove cancellations/returns
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;


**Insight:** Identifies the most profitable products.
📂**Result:** results/best_selling_products.csv

🔹**Problem 2:** Customer Purchase Behavior

**Query:** Top 10 customers by total spend, with rank.

WITH customer_spend AS (
  SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice), 2) AS total_spent
  FROM `your_project.your_dataset.Online_Retail`
  WHERE Quantity > 0
  GROUP BY CustomerID
)
SELECT 
  CustomerID,
  total_spent,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS spend_rank
FROM customer_spend
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;


**Insight:** Highlights high-value customers and revenue concentration.
📂**Result:** results/customer_purchase_behavior.csv

🔹**Problem 3:** Monthly Sales Trend

**Query:** Revenue trends across year/month.

SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM InvoiceDate) AS year,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM InvoiceDate) AS month,
  ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice), 2) AS monthly_revenue
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.Online_Retail`
WHERE Quantity > 0
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;


**Insight:** Useful for detecting seasonality and demand spikes.
📂**Result:** results/monthly_sales_trend.csv
