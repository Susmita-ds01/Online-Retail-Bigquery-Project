## ðŸš€ Problems Solved

---

### ðŸ”¹ Problem 1: Best-Selling Products
**Query:** Top 10 products by total revenue.  
`SELECT Description AS product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice), 2) AS total_revenue FROM your_project.your_dataset.Online_Retail WHERE Quantity > 0 GROUP BY product ORDER BY total_revenue DESC LIMIT 10;`

**Insight:** Identifies the most profitable products.  
ðŸ“‚ **Result:** [results/best_selling_products.csv](results/best_selling_products.csv)  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Problem 2: Customer Purchase Behavior
**Query:** Top 10 customers by total spend, with rank.  
`WITH customer_spend AS ( SELECT CustomerID, ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice), 2) AS total_spent FROM your_project.your_dataset.Online_Retail WHERE Quantity > 0 GROUP BY CustomerID ) SELECT CustomerID, total_spent, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS spend_rank FROM customer_spend ORDER BY total_spent DESC LIMIT 10;`

**Insight:** Highlights high-value customers and revenue concentration.  
ðŸ“‚ **Result:** [results/customer_purchase_behavior.csv](results/customer_purchase_behavior.csv)  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Problem 3: Monthly Sales Trend
**Query:** Revenue trends across year/month.  
`SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM InvoiceDate) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM InvoiceDate) AS month, ROUND(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice), 2) AS monthly_revenue FROM your_project.your_dataset.Online_Retail WHERE Quantity > 0 GROUP BY year, month ORDER BY year, month;`

**Insight:** Useful for detecting seasonality and demand spikes.  
ðŸ“‚ **Result:** [results/monthly_sales_trend.csv](results/monthly_sales_trend.csv)
